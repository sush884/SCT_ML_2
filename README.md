# K-Means Clustering on Mall Customer Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **K-Means clustering algorithm** to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.  
The analysis helps businesses understand customer segments for targeted marketing and improved decision-making.  

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Mall Customer Dataset  
- **Features**: CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score  
- **Source**: [Mall Customer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## 🚀 Steps Implemented
1. Importing and exploring the dataset  
2. Performing data preprocessing  
3. Using the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters  
4. Applying the **K-Means algorithm**  
5. Visualizing customer segments  

## 📈 Results
- Customers are grouped into distinct clusters based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.  
- Visualizations show clear separations of customer groups.  

## 💡 Applications
- Customer segmentation for marketing  
- Personalized product recommendations  
- Identifying high-value customers
